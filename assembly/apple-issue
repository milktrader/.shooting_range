Okay so I was able to work this out. 

Rather then go down the rabbit hole of "how do I get i386 to work" which I frankly do not recommend anyone to do. 

Switch the target architecture to: darwin64-x86_64-cc 

and more than likely whatever you were trying to do with i386 will work fine on x86_64. 

That is the case for me anyways.
